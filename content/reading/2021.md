1. [Leanardo Da Vinci](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci) A great biography of Leonardo Da Vinci. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Learning about the life of Da Vinci inspired me to start building my drawing habilities. Moreover reading about his life has made realize the power of observation as well as the benefits of being curious about a wide field of things. Da Vinci's genius is really the mix of those two things, uncanny observation habilities paired with relentless curiosity. It is obvious that such observational skills were developed in response to his choosen trajectory as a painter and drawer. The great news as the author of the book points out. Observational skills are just like any other skill and can be developed and improved over time. I finished this book encouraged to broaden my curiosity, think about how to be more observant and not feel bad about unfinished creative work.
2.[The call of the Wild](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1852.The_Call_of_the_Wild) I have never read a book written from the point of view of the animal, a dog in this case. I enjoyed it, though, at times, the content was violent making it hard to read. This book made crave for the outdoors. Jack London has great talent in using words to describe nature. A bit short.
