1. [Leanardo Da Vinci](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci) A great biography of Leonardo Da Vinci. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Learning about the life of Da Vinci inspired me to start building my drawing habilities. Moreover reading about his life has made realize the power of observation as well as the benefits of being curious about a wide field of things. Da Vinci's genius is really the mix of those two things, uncanny observation habilities paired with relentless curiosity. It is obvious that such observational skills were developed in response to his choosen trajectory as a painter and drawer. The great news as the author of the book points out. Observational skills are just like any other skill and can be developed and improved over time. I finished this book encouraged to broaden my curiosity, think about how to be more observant and not feel bad about unfinished creative work.
2. [The call of the Wild](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1852.The_Call_of_the_Wild) I have never read a book written from the point of view of the animal, a dog in this case. I enjoyed it, though, at times, the content was violent making it hard to read. This book made crave for the outdoors. Jack London has great talent in using words to describe nature. A bit short.
3. [Courage to be disliked](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43306206-the-courage-to-be-disliked). An interesting read describing the ideas of [Alfred Adler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Adler). Some of my key takeaways from the book is  that the individual manages his/her decisions, and they are not( I choose to believe they are minimally) influenced by his/her past. This is a somewhat contrarian view currently, where most of us believe that our choices are heavily influeced by our past experiences(good or bad). The other key idea of this book is how many of our problems are rooted in relantionship problems, we look for approval from people arounds, or fail to realize that contribution to a community is the point of life. Yes Alfred Alder unambiogously identifies contribution to a community as a path to a happy life.
4.[Seveneves](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22816087-seveneves) A fantastic science fiction book on human extra-terrestrial life and its possibilities. I learned how much I don't know about orbital mechanics and sometimes the description of orbital paths were hard to follow.
