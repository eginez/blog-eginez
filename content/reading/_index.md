  * I really enjoyed reading this book and learning about Carlo's ideas on time. It was fascinating to think about space not as a continous phenomena but as a discrete process and more importantly a non-infinite discrete processes. I enjoyed reading about the authors and scientists behind our current understanding of spacetime and it was enlighting to learn that Einstein genious was not his command of physics or mathematics but his creatitivy and tenacity. This book also made me realize that general relativity and quantum mechanics have been with us for around 100 years, yet we teach it mostly at the college level(this was my experience anyway), why?.
