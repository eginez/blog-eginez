1. Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky. I have tried reading this book before, and this year I finally finished. I had high expectations about the philosophical content on it, unfortunately I was a bit dissapointent when I actually read it. I also found the practice of using different names for the same character extremely confusing(probably why I stopped reading the book earlier).
2. [Why the Dutch are different by](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25860139-why-the-dutch-are-different) A summary of Dutch history and culture. Very entertaining though a little light on the historical content.
