1. The Fabric of Reality by [David Deutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch) I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, it exposed in more intuitive way to the concept of emerging complexity. David's ideas on complexity theory, epistemology, evolution and quantum mechanics as the foundation of knowledge are certainly bold, specially the claim that all there is to know can be known by understanding those. I appreciated his thoughs on inductivism and the perils of it when applied to science. I'd like to keep investigating more Popperian philosophy.
2. [The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acts_of_King_Arthur_and_His_Noble_Knights) by John Steinback. This was my first book John S. and actually my first literary encounter with King Arthur's tales. The book was very fast paced and at a times I felt I was missing a lot of details, overall I was entertaining read.
3. [Quantum computing since Democritus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17471298-quantum-computing-since-democritus) by Scott Aaronson not a simple read, but very entertaining. I enjoyed learning about the many other of complexity classes even though at times it was hard to comprehend. I thoroughly enjoyed his explanations on quantum mechanics and negative probabilities and the chapter that was least accessible to me was the hidden variables chapter. Analyzing the power of computers in the presence of [CTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve) or the PCTC complexity class was a entertaining and informative excercise. I borrowed this book from the library by I wish I owned it as I am sure I would go back and re-read a lot of the chapters.
4. [Algorithm Desgin]() by Steven Skiena. Nothing new here, except for the [annealing technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) which I found to be extremely interesting.
