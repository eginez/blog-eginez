1. The Fabric of Reality by [David Deutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch) I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, it exposed in more intuitive way to the concept of emerging complexity. David's ideas on complexity theory, epistemology, evolution and quantum mechanics as the foundation of knowledge are certainly bold, specially the claim that all there is to know can be known by understanding those. I appreciated his thoughs on inductivism and the perils of it when applied to science. I'd like to keep investigating more Popperian philosophy.
